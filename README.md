# CSV-Report-Processing - General info

This is a simple function which reads CSV file entered by the User, converts the data in it and returns transformed data as a new CSV file.  

## Python Internship Tasks 1

General task was to write a Python script that reads a CSV file of such third-party data. Based on
standard input, the script should output a CSV file.

## Technologies:

-Python 3.7

## Modules, packages and libraries:

- pandas
- pycountry
- sys

## Start-up:

To run this project, install it locally using for example cmd:

```
pip install pandas 
pip install pycountry
```
To check how is this working you can use an example of CSV file with data (data taken from 'Internship Tasks') which is added to the project.

You can run the script in terminal:
```
python csv_report_processing.py
```
